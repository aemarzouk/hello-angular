This is a Hello World I created while learning Angular 4. It can be as a quick start guide for how to build Angular applications by following the commits from start to end.

**Note:** This code is adapted from the "Learn Angular 2 Development By Building 12 Apps" course (available [here](https://www.udemy.com/learn-angular-2-development-by-building-10-apps/)). 



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
